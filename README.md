Data analysis for Covid 19 Pandemic using Jupyter notebook in the Anaconda environment. Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry

Covid-19 is an ongoing global pandemic,caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 8th Dec 2021, more than 267 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 5.27 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

The main aim of this analysis is to extensively study the havocs caused by Covid in different countries across the globe since its very beginning. In this analysis, I worked with variables like Covid cases , mortality and Vaccination and their impact on different countries.

In this project, Using Python - I learned : Data cleaning and Data Wrangling, Exploratory analysis, Machine Learning Techniques – regression and clustering ,Geospatial analysis, Analysing time series data.

Data used in this analysis is openly sourced from ourworldindata.org. This data describes the country wise details for the important variables like cases, deaths, vaccination and many more from beginning of the Pandemic till 10th Dec 2021. The original data set has 138727 Rows and 28 Columns.

My Python repository contains - Scripts in Jupyter and the Final presentation prepared in Tableau & Powerpoint.

In this project I mainly worked with Jupyter in Anaconda Environment, using Libraries like Pandas, numpy , OS and for few tasks I also used libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for creating visualizations in Python.I also used like folium and json for Geospatial Analysis and sklearn for Machine learning - Regression and Cluster Analysis.

For drawing insights, I first started with exploring the relationships between different variables in data, then I worked on the strongest relationships. While analyzing Number of People vaccinated & Mortality rate, I formed the hypothesis – “ Countries with high vaccination rates have low mortality “
Later I tested that hypothesis using regression analysis in python and found out that the relationship between the variables was not entirely linear and there were many outliers

As Linear regression wasn’t enough to fully explain the data, so I used another non linear approach to analyze the data – Cluster Analysis where I was able to group the data into three different clusters and by further analyzing the differences in clusters , I was able to identify the where are these clusters located and how differently all the countries are coping with the Pandemic. I created Geospatial visulaization to locate the clusters, also created visulizations like bar graphs, Scatter plots, Correlation Matrixs.
